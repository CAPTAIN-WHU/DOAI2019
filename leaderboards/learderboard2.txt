The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

The data is preprocessed according to the official script provided, then be entered into the fater rcnn res101 fpn neural network to train, and finally the test is performed. The difference between DOTA version 1.0 and version 1.5 is relatively large, so a minor adjustment is made here, but for the accuracy this adjustment is not significant.",

There might be some empty files--container-crane and helicopter. The model is trained under pytorch. Data of horizontal bounding boxes is not used however, in this task, label in task1 is used as training data as the mask and horizontal bounding boxes are extracted from masks. The model was trained slowly because of large size of images, so images are resized to 1024*1024 before read into net, with label resized too. The result was reached with 60 epoches and 1000 images per step. Let\u2019s see how this network work.",

            "description": "The test results we submit are generated with our detection network which use a novel one - stage detection struction and achieve good results in remote sensing image detection. We took the first-order hourglass network as our backbone network, and added four detectors to the backbone network to detect objects of different scales, and superimposed the features of different scales on the channels, that is, features of different scales were fused. In addition, we also use the feature enhancement network to prevent the feature information of small objects from gradually disappearing with the increase of network depth. Our method effectively improves the accuracy of target detection, but the detection speed is still in the leading level.The results of this submission is based on the model we have trained for 15,000 epochs.",
