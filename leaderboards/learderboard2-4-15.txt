            "description": "We design a one-stage quadrilateral detector based on YOLOv3.In addition to the horizon bounding box regression, we stimulate the method of Textbox++ for predict the relative position of four vertexes to the HBB using logistic regression. The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

            "description": "The test results we submit are generated with our detection network which use a novel one - stage detection struction and achieve good results in remote sensing image detection. We took the first-order hourglass network as our backbone network, and added four detectors to the backbone network to detect objects of different scales, and superimposed the features of different scales on the channels, that is, features of different scales were fused. In addition, we also use the feature enhancement network to prevent the feature information of small objects from gradually disappearing with the increase of network depth. Our method effectively improves the accuracy of target detection, but the detection speed is still in the leading level.The results of this submission is based on the model we have trained for 15,000 epochs.",
