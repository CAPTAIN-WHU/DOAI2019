We add semantic segmentation branch to RPN head, and utilize multi-stage FPN feature as well as semantic feature to enhance feature representation in RCNN head. Both in training and testing, we split the original images with 1024 and gap 512, and using DOTA_devkit to merge results when testing. We used multi-scale training&testing, and augmentations like flip and rotate when testing. We trained three models using ResNet101, ResneXt101 and ResNet101 mdcn version.

            "description": "We design a one-stage quadrilateral detector based on YOLOv3.In addition to the horizon bounding box regression, we stimulate the method of Textbox++ for predict the relative position of four vertexes to the HBB using logistic regression. The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",
