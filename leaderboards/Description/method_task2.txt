Our method is based on FPN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144), and we augment the network as PANet does (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01534). Anchor-free (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1804/1804.09003.pdf) is adopted in RPN stage, and we directly regress oriented bounding box in this stage. Then we propose the oriented bounding box in R-CNN with Rotated RoIAlign (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). We adopt Cascade R-CNN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00726) with two steps. The proposed bounding boxes are both oriented in these two steps, but different IoU calculation methods are used. In the first stage, the IoU is not related to length of target box, we intercept part of target boxâ€™s long side to get the largest IoU between proposed box and the intercepted target box. In this way, some long boxes will also have corresponding positive samples. Traditional IoU calculation method is used in the second R-CNN. We calculate the minimum bounding box including oriented bounding box as horizonal bounding box. Class balance resampling, image rotation, multi-scale training & testing and model assembling are used for better performance. When model assembling, three models are used whose backbone is ResNeXt-101(32x4). Finally, we combine training set with validation set for training. Our code is implemented based on mmdetection (https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/).
